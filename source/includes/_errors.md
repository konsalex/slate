# Errors

<aside class="notice">This error section is stored in a separate file in `includes/_errors.md`. Slate allows you to optionally separate out your docs into many files...just save them to the `includes` folder and add them to the top of your `index.md`'s frontmatter. Files are included in the order listed.</aside>

The Kittn API uses the following error codes:


Error Code | Meaning
---------- | -------
0 | All Good -- Your request was wonderful
1 | UUID you requested not found
2 | Invalid UUID
<>0 | Something Happend.
